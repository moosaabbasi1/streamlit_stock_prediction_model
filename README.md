# Heart Disease Analysis & Prediction

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the `heart.csv` dataset to identify patterns and factors contributing to heart disease. It utilizes Python's data science stack to clean, visualize, and process clinical data.

## Dataset
- **File:** `heart.csv`
- **Features:** Includes age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol, and target (presence of disease).

## Technical Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas (Data manipulation), NumPy (Numerical processing), Matplotlib/Seaborn (Visualization).

## Key Tasks
1. **Data Cleansing:** Handling missing values and ensuring correct data types.
2. **EDA:** Visualizing heart disease distribution across different age groups and genders.
3. **Correlation Analysis:** Identifying which clinical factors are most linked to heart conditions.

# Insurance Valuation Project

## Project Overview
A data-driven approach to understanding insurance costs and "valuable" metrics using historical data. The project involves preprocessing raw insurance data and performing statistical analysis.

## Dataset
- **File:** `insurance valuable.csv`
- **Focus:** Likely covers demographic data (age, BMI, region) and their impact on insurance charges/value.

## Technical Stack
- **IDE:** Cursor / VS Code (Jupyter Notebooks)
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.

## Implementation Details
- **Preprocessing:** Cleaning the `insurance valuable.csv` file.
- **Visuals:** Plotting cost trends and demographic distributions.
- **Insights:** Summary of factors that most significantly influence insurance valua
